# CamliClipper
Chrome extension for clipping web images and sending to [Camlistore](www.camlistore.org)

##Notes
- WIP: This is a work-in-progress.
- Currently almost everything is hard-coded, so if you're not using against localhost:3179 you're going to have to modify all the functions. Working on that...
- For installation, follow the directions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
