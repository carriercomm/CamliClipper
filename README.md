# CamliClipper
Chrome extension for clipping web images and sending to [Camlistore](www.camlistore.org).

In addition to basic image upload, you can provide additional metadata for the image's permanode such as:
- source URL of the image
- URL of the page where you found the image
- tags to apply to the image

##Notes
- WIP: This is a work-in-progress. [Status](https://github.com/dotMR/CamliClipper/issues)
- I've tried to conform to the full camlistore sign/upload process. But if I missed something, let me know.
- Currently only supports localhost no-auth (no Basic userpass AUTH). The server URL and any default tags can be supplied via the extension 'Options'.
- For installation, follow the directions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
